I officially dont know what im coding anymore :dead

though everything works, i just simply lost track of what is what and there are probably 30+ functions and more to come.

Interfaces are everywhere and constant clearing / creating jaframe, navigation to who knows where

There are probably 10 + interface class and more to come . . .

optimising the code and cleaning up will be a pain because everything is linked together and one change will affect everything :sigh

good luck to anyone who is trying to read the code :salute
